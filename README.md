# Comparison of Data Manipulation Libraries in Python

This project, created with Streamlit, aims to compare different data processing libraries in Python, such as Pandas, Polars, Dask, Modin, among others. Below are the key objectives and contributions of the project.

## Project Objectives

### 1. Performance Evaluation
- **Performance Comparison**: Evaluate the speed and memory usage of different libraries for specific operations.
- **Efficiency Identification**: Determine which library is more efficient for different types of tasks and datasets.

### 2. Decision Facilitation
- **Informed Choice**: Help users select the appropriate library for their particular use case, based on empirical data on performance and efficiency.
- **Pros and Cons**: Provide clear information on the advantages and disadvantages of each library.

### 3. Education and Learning
- **Educational Tool**: Serve as an educational tool for new users to learn about the different libraries and their capabilities.
- **Practical Examples**: Provide practical examples and comparisons that facilitate the understanding of complex concepts.

### 4. Resource Optimization
- **Efficient Resource Use**: Help developers optimize the use of computational resources by choosing the most suitable library for their needs.
- **Efficient Practices**: Promote efficient practices in handling large volumes of data.
